# Connect-Outpatient-Using-IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a norm in the current IT industry and it’s going to be a part of our daily life. The healthcare industry is the largest beneficiary from the IoT as a large number of medical devices are getting connected to the Internet. Many companies are spending huge amount of resources to connect healthcare industry with IoT.  

Currently, many people face severe consequences as they are not able to take lifesaving actions on time. According to research data over 600,000 people die due to heart disease and heart attacks each year in the United States. 911 Emergencies offer quick service in emergencies, but even it takes around 10 minutes to reach a patient. Sometimes people don’t even have sufficient time or a third person to inform 911. Also, many people cannot afford hefty healthcare costs. This scenario can be improved by integrating IoT in healthcare. There are many medical devices and applications which are available in the market, but often they fail to address this combined issue.

We are planning to offer better solution by integrating our application with existing IoT devices. Our solution will guide outpatient to follow doctor’s instructions while they are taking treatment at home. Through big data analytics, it will also send emergency notifications to related doctors, relatives and 911 emergencies. In this way, we are planning to improve communication channel with reduced healthcare cost.
